# My-Portfolio

Hello and Welcome to My Portfolio! 

My name is Nathen Calderon and I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at Loyola University Chicago. 

This is a collection of projects I have undertaken, in my academic career, personal time, and previous jobs I have worked. 

Unfortunately, some git logs will not be visible because I am pulling these projects from my home directory. Folders for each project will contain a simple text file detailing my understanding of the project, my own input, and any input provided from outside sources.

Please reach out to me @ natecalderon715@gmail.com with any questions or concerns and I will respond as soon as I can.

Thank You!
