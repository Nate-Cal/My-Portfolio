Must predict if passenger survived according to data

File test.csv

Headers: PassengerId (Int), Pclass (Int), Name (String), Sex (String, possible boolean), Age (Int), SibSp (Int), Parch (Int), Ticket (String), Fare (Double), Cabin (String), Embarked (Char)

Absurd amount of if statements +/-

EX:
if age < some number: continue
    else youre dead

Will need to do for each feature, predictions are not weight based and therefore will


Attributing weight to features


I need a value at the end of every row for each index/pid
+= 1 to survival rate
If survival rate is => some number, pass true to survived
Else pass false

Return PassengerId with Survived value
